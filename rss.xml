&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&apos;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello there and welcome to the OAsome blog. This is a blog of couple who guess what, their initials start with an A and an O. They both really like visiting new places, finding out about interesting adventures and take casual photos.
This blog also gives an area for friends to share some of their experiences or fandfull trips they find out during their travel adventures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay we agree, you would say all good but why another travel blog. And truth to be told we thought about this some time as well, but we ended up deciding because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone has something different to offer in terms of adventures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we think we have experiences that could be useful for other people, just like other and wil provide insights for us at some point during our travels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is fun and you should try it to!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we document our experiences in a beautiful and constructive way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not your typical travel blog couple that is in another country every month or week or... We are no digital nomads nor backpackers wandering around the world although we guess we both would love to try this out. We work as statitician and computer scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just a normal couple living currently in Paris in their mid-tweenties that has the opportunity through two stable jobs, saving money and much much desire to travel 3-4 times per year. We have been in France for 5 years now but we are originally from Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our travel adventures involve every time a mix bag of everything: museums, ancient temples, wandering around the streets to get the feel of cities and villages, hikings, food and alcohol tasting, swimming, snorkeling, sailing, zip-lining and taking lots of photos. We are no professional or anything. You could probably describe us best as amateur click happy more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have not been to many countries yet, but we will try to provide details, tips and photos from our trips in Mexico, Usa, Greece, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and some interesting tips about Paris and Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&apos;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amerika we are coming 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[Who let the dogs out?
