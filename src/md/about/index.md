# Where am I?

Hello there and welcome to the OAsome blog. This is a blog of couple who guess what, their initials start with an A and an O. They both really like visiting new places, finding out about interesting adventures and take casual photos.
This blog also gives an area for friends to share some of their experiences or fandfull trips they find out during their travel adventures

# Why another travel blog?

Yay we agree, you would say all good but why another travel blog. And truth to be told we thought about this some time as well, but we ended up deciding because:

 * everyone has something different to offer in terms of adventures
 * we think we have experiences that could be useful for other people, just like other and wil provide insights for us at some point during our travels.
 * it is fun and you should try it to!
 * we document our experiences in a beautiful and constructive way

# So who are you?

We are not your typical travel blog couple that is in another country every month or week or... We are no digital nomads nor backpackers wandering around the world although we guess we both would love to try this out. We work as statitician and computer scientist.

We are just a normal couple living currently in Paris in their mid-tweenties that has the opportunity through two stable jobs, saving money and much much desire to travel 3-4 times per year. We have been in France for 5 years now but we are originally from Cyprus.

Our travel adventures involve every time a mix bag of everything: museums, ancient temples, wandering around the streets to get the feel of cities and villages, hikings, food and alcohol tasting, swimming, snorkeling, sailing, zip-lining and taking lots of photos. We are no professional or anything. You could probably describe us best as amateur click happy more than anything.

We have not been to many countries yet, but we will try to provide details, tips and photos from our trips in Mexico, Usa, Greece, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and some interesting tips about Paris and Cyprus.
