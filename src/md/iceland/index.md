# Preparation

We had been longing to do this trip for quite a long time. Beautiful sceneries, awesome hikings, breathtaking views, amazing sunrises and sunsets, pallets full of colors. This trip was always going to be packed with excitement.

We were lucky, one of us had to attend a conference in Las Vegas in a way that we were really close to those places and we no longer had the opportunity to postpone this trip! Only hindsight was that we only had 7 nights to spend in the area and we had to prepare as much as possible, from accomodation to restaurants to almost the exact timeline of the trip. We had too many things to see and fit in a short timespace that preparation proved to be of great importance.

<tip title="Flexible accomodation!">
Keep in mind that even with the best preparation around, your plans might change.
For instance we had to cancel our Yosemite visit due to fires and replace it. Having booked everything with free cancellation to the very last day enabled us to change plans even at the last minute.
</tip>

<tip title="Be prepared to drive, a lot!">
If you intend to visit for as few days as we did, visit as many things as we did, then keep in mind that you'll drive a lot. We didn't spend more than one day in the same place and we were every day up early to move and hit it going. We would definitely add another 3 days in this trip had we had the chance.

# Itinerary

Since we wouldn't have a second chance for complementing this trip we decided to drive a
lot but catch a tiny glimpse of the locations we were the most fond of. This included
spending a day at Death Valley, comparing ourselves to the giant Sequoias, hiking the narrows at Zion national park, witnessing the nature architecture at Bryce, visiting Navajo lands (Antelope canyon and Monument Valley) and finally spending the day at Grand Canyon.

<tip title="Visiting more than 3 parks?">
Equip yourself with the annual pass. You will save money and time since you only need to present the card and then proceed. They are sold in most visitor centers. We got ours at Death Valley.
</tip>

We managed to do just that, although i guess with a couple of more days to spare our trip would
have been much more relaxed and we could have hiked a bit more. Neverthless we thouroughly enjoyed our trip so here's how it happened!
