We are no digital nomads nor backpackers wandering around the world although we guess we both would love to try this out. We work as statitician and computer scientist.</p>\n<p>We are just a normal couple living currently in Paris in their mid-tweenties that has the opportunity through two stable jobs, saving money and much much desire to travel 3-4 times per year. We have been in France for 5 years now but we are originally from Cyprus.</p>\n<p>Our travel adventures involve every time a mix bag of everything: museums, ancient temples, wandering around the streets to get the feel of cities and villages, hikings, food and alcohol tasting, swimming, snorkeling, sailing, zip-lining and taking lots of photos. We are no professional or anything. You could probably describe us best as amateur click happy more than anything.</p>\n<p>We have not been to many countries yet, but we will try to provide details, tips and photos from our trips in Mexico, Usa, Greece, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and some interesting tips about Paris and Cyprus.</p>\n<h1 id=\"using-the-content-the-photos-or-the-code-of-this-blog\"><a href=\"#using-the-content-the-photos-or-the-code-of-this-blog\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using the content, the photos or the code of this blog</h1>\n<p>First let us thank you for showing the interest in our blog.
